# plover-sqlite-dictionary
SQLite-based dictionary format for Plover. Consumes less memory for large dictionaries.

There are two possible file formats:

* SQLite-based: `.sql` extension. (*not implemented*)
* JSON: stored as plain JSON file on disk. `.jssql` extension. Takes longer to load.

Can be used like a normal Plover dictionary.
